# Standard Operating Procedures for Digital Identity Systems
_**Standard Operating Procedures**_ (SOPs) are a set of step-by-step instructions that explain in detail the ways to execute a function. SOPs typically decompose a function into discrete processes, with each process comprising sequential procedures. By following SOPs, system administrators promote a standardised approach to operation and working with consistent outcomes per function, thereby, ensuring conformance and consistency.

The aim of this work is to design SOPs that accommodate the Minimal Acceptable Functionality (MAF) and Exemplar Digital Identity (DID) system. The MAF system is the set of functions which enable its most basic execution where as the Exemplar versions aims to acheive a state-of-the-art systems. The following three phases (listed below) are the essential phases in a DID system. Each phase contains a series of functions that must be executed for the MAF and Exemplar. These phases are:

1.	Onboarding – The registration, validation and verification of an applicant’s claimed identity.
2.	Authentication – The mechanisms for approving the identity of an applicant or a claimant.
3.	DID Lifecycle Management – The recording, maintenance and management of the DID account holder.

These SOPs are subject to further improvements and provides an initial approach to developing further complex and depended Digital Identity System. For changes, suggestions and improvments, please contact asheik@turing.ac.uk.
