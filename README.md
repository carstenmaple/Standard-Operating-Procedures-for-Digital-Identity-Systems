# Standard Operating Procedures for Digital Identity Systems
_**Standard Operating Procedures**_ (SOPs) are a set of step-by-step instructions that explain in detail how to execute a function. SOPs typically decompose a function into discrete processes, with each process comprising sequential procedures (the instructions for that process). By following SOPs, administrators promote a standardised manner of working with consistent outcomes per function.
The aim of this work was to design SOPs that accommodate the Minimal Acceptable Functionality (MAF) and Exemplar Digital Identity (DID) system. The MAF system is the set of functions which enable its most basic execution where as the Exemplar versions aims to acheive a state of the art systems. There are three essential phases in a DID system. Each phase contains a series of functions that must be executed for the MAF and Exemplar. These phases are:
1.	Onboarding – The registration, validation and verification of an applicant’s claimed identity.
2.	Authentication – The modules and mechanisms for approving the identity of an applicant or a claimant (a person who claims to possess a registered identity).
3.	DID Lifecycle Management – The recording, maintenance and management of the DID account holder.
