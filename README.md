# Introduction
Governments around the world are committed to supporting the roll out of national digital IDs, but there are privacy and security implications associated with scaling these systems at a national level.

Responsible implementation of ID services is a critical enabler for financial inclusion; it enables access to services and enactment of civil rights. According to the World Bank, more than one billion people are currently living without an official digital identity.

The Alan Turing Institute is joining a vibrant community of NGOs, charities, private sector providers, universities and think tanks addressing global identity challenges in the digital age.

Questions of trust are based around the complex interplay of socio-technical considerations, requiring multi-disciplinary expertise. The ‘trustworthiness’ of digital IDs is characterised by multiple inter-related dimensions that include security, privacy, ethics, resilience, robustness and reliability. These dimensions are required to provide the knowledge, tools and guidance needed to implement privacy-preserving, secure identification systems. These set of Standard Operating Procedures aim towards developing a Trustworthy ID Systems.


# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
SOPs are a set of step-by-step instructions that explain in detail the ways to execute a function. SOPs typically decompose a function into discrete processes, with each process comprising sequential procedures. By following SOPs, system administrators promote a standardised approach to operation and working with consistent outcomes per function, thereby, ensuring conformance and consistency.

The aim of this work is to design SOPs that accommodate the Minimal Acceptable Functionality (MAF) and Exemplar Digital Identity (DID) system. The MAF system is the set of functions which enable its most basic execution where as the Exemplar versions aims to acheive a state-of-the-art systems. The following three phases (listed below) are the essential phases in a DID system. Each phase contains a series of functions that must be executed for the MAF and Exemplar. These phases are:

1.	Onboarding – The registration, validation and verification of an applicant’s claimed identity.
2.	Authentication – The mechanisms for approving the identity of an applicant or a claimant.
3.	DID Lifecycle Management – The recording, maintenance and management of the DID account holder.

These SOPs are subject to further improvements and provides an approach to developing Trustworthy Digital Identity System. For suggestion and collaboration, please contact cm@warwick.ac.uk
